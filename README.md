# RestaurantAPI
The restaurant collection file shows the endpoints. The request and responses are specified.
The project uses self hosted MySQL and MongoDB cloud. In the application properties file, the user must enter its specification according to himself/herself.
For MongoDB, the choice left the user to make and it can not use my server since the users are specified statically. However, user must specify the application.yaml file by his/her mongoDB server.
